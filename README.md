## Summary and Analysis

The Colorado Electoral Commission has requested further analysis of the election data. Turnout calculation questions for each constituency that votes in congressional districts. We have to create some code using python to answer all these questions first and who can apply to another state or county in the future based on the available dataset.

With the out file located in the resources folder we answer the following points and questions:

How many votes were cast in this congressional election?

- Total Votes: 369,711

Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
- County Votes:
 - Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
 - Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
 - Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)

Which county had the largest number of votes?

Denver

- Lets provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received:
 - Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
 - Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
 - Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

-Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
 - Winner: Diana DeGette
 - Winning Vote Count: 272,892
 - Winning Percentage: 73.8%

Colorado saw three counties tally up to 369,711 votes. The biggest of the counties with a 82.8% was Denver. We processed the votes for three candidates of Charles, Diana, and Raymon. With 73.8% of the votes towards Diana DeGette, that is 272,892 of the 369,711 total votes.
